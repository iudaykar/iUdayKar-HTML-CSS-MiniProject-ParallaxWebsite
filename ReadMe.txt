Read Me:
Hello! This is my third project & it is a Parallax Website, 
I chose this project because it caught my attention & this one interseted me in doing it,
& thought that this project will help me to get some practice & learn something new, 
& to be honest I learned a lot while working on this project,
I created this webpage using HTML & CSS & also used some images that I found on Google, 
& some similar sites from which we can download images.
I really enjoying working on this one & enjoyed the process a lot.

Thanks for reading this!
